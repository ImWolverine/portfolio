# What is Wordle?

Wordle is a popular game that involves guessing a five-letter secret word.
You get six attempts and each time you guess, you're told which of the letters are in the secret word, and whether they're in the right place.
Each day the secret word changes, so you can compete with your friends for how many guesses it takes you.

## Example Game:

import { Wordle } from './Wordle'

<Wordle words="hello,world,solve" solution="solve" />
