## What is Wordle?

Wordle is a popular game that involves guessing a five-letter secret word.
You get six attempts and each time you guess you're told which of the letters are in the secret word, and whether they're in the right place.
Each day brings a new secret word, so you can compete with your friends and try to get the fewest guesses.

### This is what a simple game would look like:

Each guess is on it's own line, and in this case, the solution was "solve".

<Wordle words="hello,world,solve" solution="solve" />

### Color meanings

- Green: this letter is in the secret word, and it's in the correct spot
- Yellow: this letter is in the secret word, but it's in the wrong spot
- Gray: this letter is not in the secret word

Now that you know how to play wordle, we can get into the real meat of this project.

## What solving strategies can we use?

There is one fundemental strategy that we can use, but there are a few different approaches to calculating how good a guess really is. The main strategy involves simulating every possible guess with every possible solution and then calculating the best one. The different approches comes with how we handle that last part, calculating a score based on the simulated guess.

There are three main ways to do this:

- Counting colors (Naïve)
- Looking ahead (Optimal)
- Using brute force (Perfect)

### Counting colors (Naïve)

The way this strategy works is by counting how many green, yellow, and gray letters we end up with after each simulated guess. We can assign points to each color, eg: (Green: 10, Yellow: 3, Gray: 1) and then average up the points for each guess. This works alright, but the main issue comes with finding optimal point values for each color, and making combinations of colors in different contexts worth more or less.

### Looking ahead (Optimal)

The way this strategy works is by simulating guesses and then counting how many solutions are possible after each guess. This approach essentially optimizes for cutting down the size of the solution set as much as possible, and works really well because of this. The only pitfall with this approach is when we fall into a scenario where there are a lot of very similar words.

### Example

We know that it ends with "atch", but there are a lot of "atch" words we need to go through.

<Wordle words="bench,latch,match,patch,natch,ratch" solution="watch" />

### Using brute force (Perfect)

The way this strategy works is by using a similar technique to the Look Ahead approach, but doesnt just look one step ahead and instead goes 6 steps ahead. This perfectly calculates the probabilistically optimal guess because it can go through the entire space of possibilities. Because it looks so far ahead, it can avoid the scenario where we have many similar words like above. This approach might seem perfect, and it is, but a glaring issue arises when we actually implement it: It takes a LONG time to go through all possible wordle games.

## So, which strategy is the best?

While all of these strategies work well in their own regard, the best strategy for realistically computing the best next guess is with the Looking Ahead approach.

## How do we code it?

I'm going to use python for this project because it's easy to read and write while being somewhat fast for a project like this.

### Implement a `simulate_guess` function

The base of the whole program is this function which takes in a guess and a solution and spits out colors for each letter. At first glance it seems pretty simple, and that something like this would work.

#### Naïve method

```python
def simulate_guess(guess, solution):
  colors = []
  for i, letter in enumerate(guess):
    if letter == solution[i]:
      colors.append(3) # Green
    else if letter in solution:
      colors.append(2) # Yellow
    else:
      colors.append(1) # Gray
  return colors
```

#### Proper method

```python
def simulate_guess(guess, solution):
  # All the indices that are not green
  not_green = [i for i, letter in enumerate(guess) if letter != solution[i]]

  # Counter of the letters in the solution that are not green
  counts = Counter(solution[i] for i in not_green)

  # Prepare color_combo with all green
  color_combo = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]

  # Loop through all letters that arent green
  for letter_index in not_green:

    # Guess letter thats not green
    letter = guess[letter_index]

    # If there are remaining available yellows for the letter
    if counts[letter] > 0:
      # Set to yellow and reduce the count
      color_combo[letter_index] = 1
      counts[letter] -= 1
    else:
      # Set to gray
      color_combo[letter_index] = 0

  return color_combo
```

### Implement a `possible_words` function

```python
def possible_words(words, guesses):
  for guesses in guesses:
    words = [
      word for word in words
        if simulate_guess(guesses["word"], word) == guesses["colors"]
    ]
  return words
```

### Implement a `word_score` function

#### Naïve method

```python
def word_score(guess, solutions):
  total = 0
  for solution in solutions:
    total += len(
      possible_words(solutions, [{
        'word': guess,
        'colors': simulate_guess(guess, solution)
      }])
    )
  return total / len(solutions)
```

#### Efficient method

```python
def word_score(guess, solutions):
  color_combos = []
  for solution in solutions:
    color_combos.append(tuple(simulate_guess(guess, solution)))

  counts = Counter(color_combos).values()

  average = 0
  for count in counts:
    chance = count / sum(counts)
    average += chance * count

  return average
```

#### With list comprehension & lambda

```python
word_score = lambda (guess, solutions): sum(count ** 2 for count in Counter(tuple(simulate_guess(guess, solution)) for solution in solutions).values()) / len(solutions)
```
